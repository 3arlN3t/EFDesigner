<h2>Entity Framework visual design surface and code-first code generation for EF6, EFCore and beyond.</h2>

<p>This Visual Studio 2017 IDE extension adds a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for visual design of persistent classes. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in the visual model, as is the ability to add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design. T4 files are used to generate code-first DBContext and POCO class files for both EF6 and EFCore, and these can be modified to generate your own particular style.</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center" width="100%">
<img src="images/Designer.jpg" width="95%" />
</td></tr></table>

<p>If you are used to the Entity Framework visual modeling that came with prior versions of Visual Studio, you’ll be pretty much at home. The goal was to duplicate at least those features and, in addition, all the things that should have been there. Things like</p>
<ul>
  <li>the ability to show and hide parts of the model</li>
  <li>easy customization of generated output</li>
  <li>class nodes that can be colored to visually group the model</li>
  <li>different concerns that can be generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)</li>
  <li>entities by default being generated as partials so the default code can be easily modified</li>
  <li>string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer</li>
  <li>plus many other tiny bits that kept getting under my skin.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of my biggest annoyances with EF has been the completely disparate approaches in code-first, model-first and database-first. There is no logical reason why these approaches couldn’t center around a common, easily used core. <a href="https://github.com/sjh37">Simon Hughes</a> has been doing a great job with his <a href="https://github.com/sjh37/EntityFramework-Reverse-POCO-Code-First-Generator">EntityFramework-Reverse-POCO-Code-First-Generator</a> project, and this extension aims to continue that momentum with visual modeling, centering everything on what’s been commonly called “code-first” EF. Because, frankly, the conceptual schema definition language (CSDL), store schema definition language (SSDL), and mapping specification language (MSL) are implementation details that a good tool should just plain abstract away.</p>

<p>This documentation is a work-in-progress, but I wanted to get the project out so folks could kick the tires and let me know what needs fixing. The tool has been used in production (i.e., generating code for real projects) for quite a while, but more eyes and different approaches are always good.</p>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Install the plugin by either downloading the VSIX file in the /dist directory or, better, using NuGet to pull it from the Visual Studio Marketplace. The NuGet approach will help you keep it up to date when enhancements and bug fixes are made.</li>
  <li>Create a project in Visual Studio – the kind of project doesn’t matter. If you haven’t already done so, use NuGet to add Entity Framework or Entity Framework Core to the project (since the code you’ll generate references it and, besides, it doesn’t make much sense to create EF code without using EF, right?).</li>
  <li>Right-click the project root and select <em>Add/New Item…</em> from the dropdown menu.</li>
  <li>With <em>Visual C# Items</em> selected in the tree to the left, find <em>EFDesigner</em> in the list on the right and select it.</li>
  <li>Rename the file to your liking. The name of the file will become the default name of the generated DbContext, though you can change that later.</li>
  <li>Click Add.</li>
  <li>Opening the <em>[your file name].efmodel</em> file will present you with a blank design surface, and your toolbox will display the items you can add to your model.</li>
  <li>Read the rest of this site to get details on things you don’t find obvious :-).</li>
</ul>
