# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! [Clone a copy of the project](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner) and have at it!

I'll attempt to work any pull requests within a few days, but can't promise anything in
stone since life can, at times, get in the way &lt;g&gt;. 

The only special setup you'll need is the [Visualization & Modeling SDK](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2016/12/12/the-visual-studio-modeling-sdk-is-now-available-with-visual-studio-2017/), which can now be
found in the Visual Studio installer. Just make sure that's been activated.

If you do have any problems compiling the code, please add an issue to the 
[GitHub issues list](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues).

And if you'd like to contribute but aren't a programmer, there's still room for you!
The project docs (the thing you're reading) could certainly be improved - it would be
great if qualified writers could help.

Looking forward to your efforts! And thanks in advance.
