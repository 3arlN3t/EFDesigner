You should think of this extension as two parts: first the design surface and, separately, the T4 templates that generate the code. The template(s) can be modified without modifying, compiling and reinstalling the extension -- it's fashioned this way so that developers can easily make whatever changes suit their fancy to how the code is generated, since everybody's got their own personal quirks on how their code should look.

# Getting Started

The design surface is where you'll create the visual model of your persistent entities. The properties
you give them here will (or should, if you make changes to the T4 templates) drive the code generation. It represents (and is used to generate) the DbContext class in your project

More than one design surface can be added to your project, just as more than one DbContext can be present. 

## Create your project

<img align="right" src="images/Solution.jpg">

Create a solution and a project. **Please note** that, as of this writing, ASP.NET Core and WebSite projects don't allow project items of type "Data" to be added via "Add New Item", so you won't be able to add an .efmodel file to those project types. 

Best practices are to create a class library project to hold your entities so that the entities can be shared across multiple host programs (web app, console app, etc.). Go ahead and delete the Class1.cs file that's automatically added.

Note that the T4 templates included in the installation only generate *C#* code, although any language _could_ be generated. We welcome any submissions of T4 templates for other languages.

Since we'll be generating code, now is a good time to create the folders where that code will eventually go. You're free to create any structure you desire. You can even decide to generate code directly into the main tree of your project, but that's rarely a good idea except for the simplest of projects . A good working structure would look like the following:

    Context
    |-- Custom
    |-- Generated
    |
    Entities
    |-- Custom
    |-- Generated
    |
    Enums
    |-- Custom
    |-- Generated

This gives you separation for your DbContext class (and its satellites), your persistent entities, and enumerations you use in those entities (generated by the model). Further separating "Custom" and "Generated" code gives you quick access to files you can modify ("Custom") and those you shouldn't ("Generated"). The "Custom" files will hold the partial classes you use to extend the generated code.
