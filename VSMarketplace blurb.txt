This Visual Studio 2017 extension adds a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for fast, easy and, most importantly, visual design of persistent classes. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in the visual model, as is the ability to add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design.
T4 files are used to generate code-first DBContext and POCO class files for both EF6 and EFCore, and these can be modified to generate your own particular style.

If you are used to the EF visual modeling that comes with Visual Studio, you'll be pretty much at home.
The goal was to duplicate at least those features and, in addition, 
add all the little things that *should* have been there. Things like: 
- the ability to show and hide parts of the model
- easy customization of generated output
- class and enumeration nodes that can be colored to visually group the model
- different concerns being generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)
- entities by default generated as partial classes so the default code can be easily modified
- string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer
and many other nice-to-have bits.
